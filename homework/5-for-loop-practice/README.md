##For Loop Exercise

###Setup

1. Log into Cloud9 **using your Github account**.

2. Find the "ScriptEd-BIHS-Winter2014" project. Open it.

3. Run the following commands in the terminal:   
     
  ``git remote set-url origin git@github.com:dopeboy/ScriptEd-BIHS-Winter2014.git``   
  ``git pull``   
  ``git remote set-url origin git@github.com:INSERT_YOUR_GITHUB_USER_NAME_HERE/MyScriptEdHomework-BIHS-Winter2014.git``   

  A new folder called "5-for-loop-practice" should appear with four files: loop.html, loop.css, loop.js, and README.md. If it doesn't, call one of the instructors over.
 
###What you have to do

Preview the loop.html file. Notice that there are four 'Execute' buttons. Once you complete each problem, you will press this button which will then replace the '?' with your answer. DO NOT CHANGE ANY EXISTING CODE.

Here is what you need to do for each problem:

1. Uncomment the for loop. Replace the question marks with the correct code.   
  **The output should look like this: "red blue green yellow gray"**

2. Write a for loop that will output the names.   
  **The output should look like this: "Edwin Natasha Manish Chris"**

3. Write a for loop that will output the 2nd, 4th, and 6th elements in the 'numbers' array.   
  **The output should look like this: "40 80 120"**

4. Write a for loop that will output the string "BK! All Day" 10 times.

###When you are done

Call over an instructor, and have them review your solution and your code.

Submit your code by following these commands:   
     
  ``git add *``   
  ``git commit -u -m "new homework"``   
  ``git push origin master``
