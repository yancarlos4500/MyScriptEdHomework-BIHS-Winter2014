#Memory Exercise

You are going to implement a basic memory game like this: http://www.kielack.com/games/memory.php

##Phase I - 03/17

The first step of this project will involve your group producing a grid using HTML and CSS.

###Setup

1. Log into Cloud9 **using your Github account**.
2. Find the "ScriptEd-BIHS-Winter2014" project. Open it.
3. Run the following commands in the terminal: 
  ``git remote set-url origin git@github.com:dopeboy/ScriptEd-BIHS-Winter2014.git``
  <br/>
  ``git pull``
  ``git remote set-url origin git@github.com:INSERT_YOUR_GITHUB_USER_NAME_HERE/MyScriptEdHomework-BIHS-Winter2014.git``

    A new folder called "3-memory-game" should appear. If it doesn't, call one of the instructors over.
 
###What you have to do

Your page needs to have the following:

1. A title up top with your team name and the text "Memory game" 
2. A 4x4 grid of squares. Each square must have a numerical ID.
3. Each square must have a question mark in it.
4. A reset button somewhere.
5. A score somewhere.

Your page needs to do the following:

1. Everytime the user clicks on a square, there should be an alert box that shows the ID of the clicked square.
2. Everytime the user clicks on the reset button, there should be an alert box that shows the text "reset clicked".


###Submission Checklist

Before submitting your homework, you must perform the following:

1. Make sure all your files are in the "3-memory-game" folder.
2. Run in the terminal:

  ``git add *``
  <br/>
  ``git commit -u -m "new homework"``
  <br/>
